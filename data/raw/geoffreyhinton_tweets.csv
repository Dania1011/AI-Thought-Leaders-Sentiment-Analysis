Check out our ICLR 2023 paper: arxiv.org/abs/2210.03310

Forward gradient computes gradient information from forward pass. But it is slow and noisy — it computes the directional gradient along a random weight perturbation. Gradient variance explodes with deeper and wider networks. 

Our key insight is to utilize local activity perturbation and we introduce a new architecture with many local losses throughout the network so that each loss is associated with a small number of weights.

Both supervised and self-supervised (contrastive) learning works. Much better than a lot of backprop-free methods on large scale problems.
